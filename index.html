              <p class="p-indent">I have been a musician all my life. Throught most of my twenties, I played trumpet, percussion, and sang harmonies in the band <a href="http://www.wearetyphoon.com/">Typhoon</a>. After years of writing, recording, and touring the US, I decided to make a career change. I have been attending <a href="https://epicodus.com/">Epicodus</a>, a programming vocational school, since February 6, 2017. So far, it's really great! This portfolio, in its current state, is the result of my first week's Friday project. Thanks for viewing!</p>

        <div class="panel-body">
          <p class="p-indent">For the past few years I worked at House Spirits Distillery in Portland, OR. Prior to that I worked a number of entry level jobs with little to no satisfaction. So far, none of the positions I've held have had anything to do with programming. I'm excited to change this and dedicate myself to the tech industry!</p>

            <li>Games
              <p>I enjoy all types of games including video and cumputer games, board games, card games, sports, puzzles, crosswords, you name it. I would love to program games.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Music
              <p>I play bass, drums, guitar, and sing on my own recordings. I would be very interested in building VST plugins for recording software, or any other music related programming.</p></li>
            <li>Brewing Beer
              <p>I've been homebrewing beer since about 2009. It's a great scientific and creative outlet. And the end result is tastey beer! I would be interested in creating software for breweries or distilleries, or even the homebrewer.</p>
